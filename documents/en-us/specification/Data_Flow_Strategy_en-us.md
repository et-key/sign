# Sign Language Foundational Data Flow Architecture

## 1. Introduction

One of the core design principles that forms the foundation of Sign language is the basic data flow pattern of "Input⇒Memory⇒Processing⇒Output." This document provides a detailed explanation of this foundational architecture, particularly focusing on its significance and implementation in multi-core environments.

### 1.1 Overview of Basic Data Flow

In Sign language, all program processing is conceived as a four-stage data flow:

```
【Input】→【Memory】→【Processing】→【Output】
```

This consistent data flow model provides a simple yet powerful abstraction and serves as the foundation for realizing Sign language's philosophy of "invisible strength."

## 2. Each Stage of Data Flow

### 2.1 Input Stage

The input stage handles data acquisition from external sources and initialization.

**Characteristics**:
- Data reading from IO devices and memory-mapped IO
- Data acquisition from file systems
- Network stream reception
- Signal reception from sensors

**Expression in Sign Language**:
```sign
` Input stage examples
` Input from hardware port
input_data : @0x1000
` Input from file
file_data : read `file.txt`
```

### 2.2 Memory Stage

The memory stage handles storage, structuring, and access preparation of input data.

**Characteristics**:
- Proper placement of data in memory regions
- Construction and initialization of data structures
- Index creation for efficient access
- Region-based memory management

**Expression in Sign Language**:
```sign
` Memory stage examples
` Memory region allocation
buffer : 0x8000
` Data storage
@buffer # input_data
` Structuring
data_structure : parse_into_structure input_data
```

### 2.3 Processing Stage

The processing stage performs operations and transformations on data stored in memory.

**Characteristics**:
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Data transformation and processing
- Conditional branching and control flow
- Recursive processing and iteration

**Expression in Sign Language**:
```sign
` Processing stage examples
` Filtering
filtered_data : data_structure ' valid_items
` Batch processing
processed : [* 2,] filtered_data
` Advanced processing
analyzed : analyze processed
```

### 2.4 Output Stage

The output stage handles transmission or storage of processing results to external destinations.

**Characteristics**:
- Transmission of processing results to output ports
- Writing to files
- Memory state updates
- Network transmission

**Expression in Sign Language**:
```sign
` Output stage examples
` Output to hardware port
0x2000 # processed
` Writing to file
write `result.txt` analyzed
```

## 3. Data Flow in Multi-core Environments

Sign language's multi-core architecture naturally realizes functional separation aligned with the basic data flow. This creates consistency between data flow and processor core allocation.

### 3.1 Correspondence Between Data Flow Stages and Core Functions

| Data Flow Stage | Corresponding Core Function | Main Operations |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Input | IO Loop Monitoring Core | Input operations via `@` (input prefix operator) |
| Memory | Memory Operation Core | Pointer operations (`$`, `@`) and memory management |
| Processing | Dedicated Processing Core | Arithmetic operations, logical operations, list processing |
| Output | IO Loop Monitoring Core | Output operations via `#` (output infix operator) |

### 3.2 Natural Load Distribution

Sign language's basic data flow promotes natural load distribution in multi-core environments:

1. **Sequential Data Processing**:
   - Data is processed sequentially: input→memory→processing→output
   - Dependencies exist between throughput of each stage, forming natural balance
   - Bottlenecks limit overall system throughput, but extreme overload of single cores is unlikely

2. **Buffering Mechanism**:
   - Buffers between stages absorb temporary load imbalances
   - Smooth data flow between cores with different processing speeds

3. **Data Dependency Self-adjustment**:
   - When upstream processes (input) are delayed, downstream processes (processing, output) naturally enter waiting state
   - Natural equilibrium forms between processing capacity and input/output capacity

## 4. Implementation Examples of Data Flow Patterns

### 4.1 Data Flow in Single-threaded Environment

```sign
` Sequential data flow: input⇒memory⇒processing⇒output
` Input stage: Data acquisition from hardware port
` Memory stage: Data analysis and structuring
` Processing stage: Data transformation processing
` Output stage: Send processing results to hardware port
process_data : ?
	0x2000 # transform parse @0x1000
```

### 4.2 Data Flow in Multi-core Environment

```sign
` IO Core responsibility
` Input stage: Data acquisition from hardware port
` Store in buffer and pass to next stage
input_handler : ?
	loop :
		input_buffer # @0x1000

` Memory Core responsibility
` Memory stage: Data acquisition from input buffer
` Skip if no data (short-circuit evaluation with & operator for Unit)
` Analyze and structure data, store in processing buffer
memory_handler : ?
	loop :
		@input_buffer & [data ?
			process_buffer # parse data
		]

` Processing Core responsibility
` Processing stage: Data acquisition from processing buffer
` Skip if no data (short-circuit evaluation with & operator for Unit)
` Transform data, store in output buffer
processing_handler : ?
	loop :
		@process_buffer & [data ?
			output_buffer # process data
		]

` Output Core responsibility
` Output stage: Data acquisition from output buffer
` Skip if no data (short-circuit evaluation with & operator for Unit)
` Send processing results to hardware port
output_handler : ?
	loop :
		@output_buffer & [result ?
			0x2000 # result
		]
```

### 4.3 Pipeline Parallelism

Basic data flow forms natural pipeline parallelism:

```sign
` Pipeline processing abstraction
` Abstract each stage as functions, process data sequentially
` Execute function composition in order: input⇒memory⇒processing⇒output
pipeline : input_fn memory_fn process_fn output_fn data ?
	@output_fn @process_fn @memory_fn @input_fn data

` Or using function composition operators (natural Sign language expression)
` Chain execution of each stage using MAP operator (,)
pipeline_natural : input_fn memory_fn process_fn output_fn ?
	[output_fn,] [process_fn,] [memory_fn,] [input_fn,]
```

## 6. Considerations and Optimizations

### 6.1 Buffer Size and Placement

Appropriate buffer design is crucial for maximizing data flow efficiency:

```sign

` Buffer size adjustment based on input speed to memory speed ratio
` Pass calculation results directly to buffer allocation function
	allocate_buffer `input` calculate_optimal_size input_rate memory_rate
` Buffer size adjustment based on processing speed to output speed ratio
` Pass calculation results directly to buffer allocation function
	allocate_buffer `output` calculate_optimal_size process_rate output_rate
```

### 6.2 Asynchronous Processing and Event-driven Mechanisms

For efficient data flow, introducing asynchronous processing and event-driven mechanisms is effective:

```sign
` Event-driven data flow
` Call handler when data arrives
on_data_available : handler ?
	register_event input_port handler

` Asynchronous processing chain
async_pipeline : ?
	on_data_available input_port [data ?
` Input stage (asynchronous): Execute data processing directly
` Notify next stage when output is ready
		notify output_ready process data
	]
```

### 6.3 Feedback Control

Introducing feedback control mechanisms is also effective for data flow optimization:

```sign
flow_control : ?
	loop :
` Monitor fill rate of each buffer and pass directly to control function
` Reduce input speed when input buffer approaches full
		measure_buffer input_buffer > 0.8 : throttle_input 0.7
` Increase input speed when input buffer has room
		measure_buffer input_buffer < 0.3 : throttle_input 1.2
` Reduce processing speed when output buffer approaches full
		measure_buffer output_buffer > 0.8 : throttle_processing 0.7
` Increase processing speed when output buffer has room
		measure_buffer output_buffer < 0.3 : throttle_processing 1.2
```

## 7. Conclusion

Sign language's basic data flow of "Input⇒Memory⇒Processing⇒Output" is a philosophical foundation that forms the core of language design, transcending mere implementation patterns. This approach enables not only clear code structuring in single-core environments but also natural parallel processing and load distribution in multi-core environments.

Sign language's multi-core architecture achieves both efficient utilization of hardware resources and consistency/readability of code by performing functional separation based on this data flow principle. Particularly important is that this data flow brings natural load distribution and has the characteristic of avoiding situations where only specific cores become extremely overloaded.

This data flow-centric approach embodies Sign language's design philosophy of "invisible strength" and "zero-cost abstraction," providing a programming environment that is intuitive for programmers while maximally utilizing hardware characteristics.
