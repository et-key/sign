# Sign Language AArch64 Implementation Strategy: Comprehensive Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the Sign language implementation for the AArch64 architecture, covering everything from design principles to strategic approaches. To realize Sign language's philosophy of "invisible strength," we adopt a simple yet highly efficient implementation strategy.

## 2. Design Philosophy: Emphasis on Simplicity

### 2.1 AArch64 Implementation Emphasizing Simplicity

The philosophy of maintaining a simple architecture is extremely important. Optimizations through case analysis increase complexity, making code harder to understand and prone to bugs.

1. **Consistent Dual Stack Structure**
   - Data Stack: Dedicated to a clearly defined register set (X8-X15)
   - Call Stack: Standard SP-based stack
   - Applied consistently without exception

2. **Clear Register Allocation**
   - Registers for data stack operations
   - Registers for temporary value storage
   - Registers for state management
   - Always the same role, same operation patterns

3. **Consistent Calling Convention**
   - Same argument passing method for all functions
   - Uniform stack frame structure
   - Simple and predictable register preservation rules

This approach allows us to minimize implementation complexity while reflecting the essence of Sign language architecture. Rather than relying on optimizations from "mere side effects," a principled and consistent design provides significant long-term benefits:

### 2.2 Advantages

Benefits of this approach:

- Reduced bug occurrence rate
- Improved development efficiency
- Ensured extensibility
- Reduced learning costs

## 3. Dual Stack Structure: Performance Analysis

We analyze in detail whether Sign language's dual stack structure (separation of data stack and call stack) is faster compared to C's standard execution model.

### 3.1 Comparison of Both Models

#### Standard C Execution Model
- **Single Stack**: Function call information and local variables coexist on the same stack
- **Register Usage**: General-purpose usage following calling conventions
- **Memory Access**: Access to local variables goes through stack memory

#### Sign Language Dual Stack Structure
- **Data Stack**: Values held in dedicated register set (X8-X15)
- **Call Stack**: Function call information only managed by SP-based stack
- **Clear Register Allocation**: Dedicated registers by purpose

### 3.2 Performance Advantages

#### 3.2.1 Reduced Memory Access
```assembly
# C method (using stack frame)
LDR X0, [SP, #16]    // Load variable a
LDR X1, [SP, #24]    // Load variable b
ADD X0, X0, X1       // Calculation
STR X0, [SP, #32]    // Save result

# Sign method (using data stack registers)
ADD X9, X8, X10      // X8=a, X10=b, result in X9
```

In the Sign method, values remain in registers, significantly reducing memory access instructions.

#### 3.2.2 Improved Cache Efficiency
- Having the data stack in registers reduces cache misses
- Registers function effectively as "L0 cache"

#### 3.2.3 Improved Pipeline Efficiency
- Predictable register usage patterns increase CPU pipeline efficiency
- Reduced stalls due to memory access waits

#### 3.2.4 Compatibility with SIMD Instructions
- The data stack model is compatible with natural SIMD optimization of list operations
- Example: Operations like `[* 2,] 1 2 3 4` can be efficiently executed with NEON instructions

### 3.3 Specific Speed Comparison Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Numerical Calculation `(a+b)*(c+d)`

```assembly
# C method
LDR X0, [X29, #a_offset]
LDR X1, [X29, #b_offset]
ADD X0, X0, X1
LDR X1, [X29, #c_offset]
LDR X2, [X29, #d_offset]
ADD X1, X1, X2
MUL X0, X0, X1

# Sign method (X8=a, X9=b, X10=c, X11=d)
ADD X12, X8, X9      // a+b
ADD X13, X10, X11    // c+d
MUL X0, X12, X13     // (a+b)*(c+d)
```

**Result**: Sign method has 4 fewer memory access instructions, theoretically about 40% faster

#### Example 2: List Processing `map (* 2) [1,2,3,4]`

```assembly
# C method (simple loop implementation)
loop:
    LDR W0, [X0], #4    // Load list element & update pointer
    LSL W0, W0, #1      // Multiply by 2
    STR W0, [X1], #4    // Save result & update pointer
    SUBS X2, X2, #1     // Decrement counter
    B.NE loop           // Repeat

# Sign method (using data stack registers)
LSL X8, X8, #1        // X8 = X8 * 2 (element 1)
LSL X9, X9, #1        // X9 = X9 * 2 (element 2)
LSL X10, X10, #1      // X10 = X10 * 2 (element 3)
LSL X11, X11, #1      // X11 = X11 * 2 (element 4)
```

**Result**: Sign method has no loop overhead and no branch misprediction, theoretically 3+ times faster

#### Example 3: Combination with SIMD Optimization

```assembly
# Sign method (using NEON SIMD)
LD4 {v0.4s}, [x0]          // Load 4 elements
MUL v0.4s, v0.4s, v1.4s    // Multiply all at once
ST4 {v0.4s}, [x0]          // Save result
```

Sign language's unified data model based on lists naturally harmonizes with such SIMD optimizations.

#### 3.3.1 Automatic SIMD Conversion of MAP Operations

Sign language MAP operations can be automatically converted to AArch64 NEON instructions:

```assembly
# Original Sign language code: [* 2,] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Auto-generated SIMD optimized code
ld1 {v0.2d, v1.2d}, [x0]     // Load 8 elements into 2 vector registers
lsl v0.4s, v0.4s, #1         // Double first 4 elements (parallel operation)
lsl v1.4s, v1.4s, #1         // Double last 4 elements (parallel operation)
st1 {v0.2d, v1.2d}, [x1]     // Save result
```

**Conditions for Automatic Conversion**:
- Element count is a multiple of 4
- Continuous application of the same operation
- No data dependencies

#### 3.3.2 Automatic Parallelization of FOLD Operations

FOLD operations (reductions) are also automatically converted to efficient parallel processing:

```assembly
# Original Sign language code: [+] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Auto-generated parallel reduction code
ld1 {v0.4s, v1.4s}, [x0]     // Load 8 elements
add v0.4s, v0.4s, v1.4s      // Parallel addition of 4+4 elements: [1+5, 2+6, 3+7, 4+8]
addp v0.4s, v0.4s, v0.4s     // Pair addition: [(1+5)+(2+6), (3+7)+(4+8), ...]
addp v0.2s, v0.2s, v0.2s     // Final horizontal addition
fmov w0, s0                  // Move result to scalar register
```

#### 3.3.3 Automatic Distribution to Multi-core Processing

For large datasets, automatic distribution to multiple cores occurs:

- **Distribution Condition**: Element count > 64 and operation cost > threshold
- **Distribution Strategy**: Data parallelism (each core processes different data ranges)
- **Synchronization Method**: Dynamic load balancing with work-stealing queue

#### 3.3.4 Advantages of AArch64 Optimization

This SIMD/parallelization achieves the following performance improvements:

- **SIMD Effect**: Single instruction processes 4-8 elements simultaneously
- **Parallel Effect**: Linear scaling with multi-core
- **Cache Efficiency**: Sequential memory access patterns
- **Branch Reduction**: Control flow optimization through loop unrolling

### 3.4 Data Stack Capacity and Large List Processing Strategy

#### 3.4.1 Data Stack Register Capacity Limitations

**Basic Capacity**:
- Data stack dedicated registers: X8-X15 (8 registers)
- Each register: 64 bits (8 bytes)
- Basic numerical data: Up to 8 elements maximum
- Pointer references: Practically unlimited (within memory limits)

```assembly
# Basic data stack usage example
# For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
mov x8, #1
mov x9, #2
mov x10, #3
mov x11, #4
mov x12, #5
mov x13, #6
mov x14, #7
mov x15, #8
```

#### 3.4.2 Hierarchical Strategy for Large List Processing

##### Level 1: Register-contained Processing (1-8 elements)
```assembly
# Small-scale list: Register-contained
# For [* 2,] [1, 2, 3, 4]
lsl x8, x8, #1    // 1 * 2
lsl x9, x9, #1    // 2 * 2
lsl x10, x10, #1  // 3 * 2
lsl x11, x11, #1  // 4 * 2
```

##### Level 2: NEON Vector Processing (9-32 elements)
```assembly
# Medium-scale list: Utilizing NEON registers
# V0-V7 (8 128-bit registers) process up to 32 32-bit values
ld1 {v0.4s, v1.4s, v2.4s, v3.4s}, [x0]  // Load 16 elements
shl v0.4s, v0.4s, #1   // Double 4 elements in parallel
shl v1.4s, v1.4s, #1   // Double 4 elements in parallel
shl v2.4s, v2.4s, #1   // Double 4 elements in parallel
shl v3.4s, v3.4s, #1   // Double 4 elements in parallel
st1 {v0.4s, v1.4s, v2.4s, v3.4s}, [x1]  // Save result
```

##### Level 3: Chunk Division Processing (33+ elements)
```assembly
# Large-scale list: Processing in chunk units
# Divide list into 32-element chunks for sequential processing
.process_large_list:
    mov x2, #32              // Chunk size
    cmp x1, x2               // Check remaining element count
    b.lt .process_remainder  // Go to remainder processing if < 32
    
    // 32-element NEON processing
    bl .process_32_elements
    add x0, x0, #128         // Next chunk (32 elements Ã— 4 bytes)
    sub x1, x1, #32          // Update remaining element count
    b .process_large_list
    
.process_remainder:
    // Process remaining elements with registers or NEON
    bl .process_small_chunk
```

#### 3.4.3 Smart Spill Strategy

##### Usage Frequency-based Spill
```assembly
# Keep frequently used values in registers
# Spill infrequently used values to memory
.smart_spill:
    # Placement based on usage frequency analysis results
    # High frequency: X8-X11 (immediate access)
    # Medium frequency: X12-X15 (1-cycle access)
    # Low frequency: Stack memory (2-3 cycle access)
    
    ldr x16, [sp, #spill_slot_1]  // Restore low-frequency data
    # Execute calculation
    str x15, [sp, #spill_slot_2]  // Temporary spill
```

##### Predictive Spill
```assembly
# Predict and preload data needed next
.predictive_management:
    # Predictive data management through loop unrolling
    prfm pldl1keep, [x0, #128]   // Prefetch next data
    ld1 {v4.4s}, [x0, #64]       // Load next processing data
    # Execute current processing
    st1 {v0.4s}, [x1], #16       // Save result and move to next
```

#### 3.4.4 Dynamic Processing Mode Switching

##### Compile-time Determination
```c
// Pseudo C++ code: Compile-time optimization determination
template<size_t N>
constexpr auto select_processing_mode() {
    if constexpr (N <= 8) {
        return register_mode{};
    } else if constexpr (N <= 32) {
        return simd_mode{};
    } else {
        return chunked_mode{};
    }
}
```

##### Runtime Adaptation
```assembly
# Runtime size determination and processing mode selection
.adaptive_processing:
    cmp x1, #8               // Element count <= 8?
    b.le .register_mode      // Register mode
    cmp x1, #32              // Element count <= 32?
    b.le .simd_mode          // SIMD mode
    b .chunked_mode          // Chunk mode

.register_mode:
    # Register-based processing
    bl .process_with_registers
    ret

.simd_mode:
    # NEON-based processing
    bl .process_with_neon
    ret

.chunked_mode:
    # Chunk division processing
    bl .process_with_chunks
    ret
```

#### 3.4.5 Memory Efficiency Optimization

##### Cache Line Optimization
```assembly
# Access aligned to cache lines (64 bytes)
.cache_optimized_access:
    # Alignment to 64-byte boundaries
    and x2, x0, #~63         // Align to 64-byte boundary
    ld1 {v0.2d, v1.2d, v2.2d, v3.2d}, [x2]  // Bulk load 64 bytes
    # Extract and process only necessary parts
```

##### Prefetch Strategy
```assembly
# Efficient prefetch patterns
.prefetch_strategy:
    prfm pldl1keep, [x0, #128]   // Prefetch to L1 cache
    prfm pldl2keep, [x0, #256]   // Prefetch to L2 cache
    prfm pstl1keep, [x1, #128]   // Prefetch write destination too
```

#### 3.4.6 Implementation Effects and Benchmark Predictions

##### Performance Characteristics
| List Size | Processing Mode | Expected Performance (vs C) | Main Optimization Elements |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1-8 elements | Register Direct | 200-400% | Memory access reduction |
| 9-32 elements | NEON Parallel | 500-800% | SIMD parallel processing |
| 33-128 elements | Hybrid | 300-600% | Chunks + prefetch |
| 129+ elements | Streaming | 150-300% | Cache efficiency |

##### Memory Usage
- **Register Mode**: No additional memory required (within 64 bytes)
- **SIMD Mode**: Temporary area 256 bytes (NEON register portion)
- **Chunk Mode**: Work area 128 bytes + prefetch buffer 256 bytes

#### 3.4.7 Automatic Tuning Mechanism

##### Profile-based Optimization
```assembly
# Automatic adjustment through runtime profiling
.profile_based_optimization:
    # Record execution count and processing time
    mrs x2, cntvct_el0       // Read timer
    # Execute processing
    mrs x3, cntvct_el0       // Timer after processing
    sub x4, x3, x2           // Calculate execution time
    # Update statistics
    bl .update_performance_stats
```

This hierarchical strategy enables Sign language to achieve consistent high performance from small numerical lists to large datasets. Particularly important is that programmers can write programs using the same notation regardless of data size, realizing the language's philosophy of "invisible strength."

### 3.5 Potential Issues and Countermeasures

#### 3.5.1 C ABI Compatibility
- Conversion overhead occurs when calling external C functions
- However, internal code maintains consistent high speed

#### 3.5.2 Context Switch Costs
- Requires saving/restoring more registers
- Hierarchical strategy enables optimization to save only minimum necessary registers

## 4. Scope-based Memory Management Strategy

### 4.1 Memory Management Hierarchy

Sign language implements three-tier memory management based on scopes:

1. **Anonymous (Immediate Release)**
   - Completed on stack
   - Released immediately when expression evaluation ends
   - Most efficient memory usage
   - High possibility of completion within AArch64 registers

2. **Local (File Unit)**
   - Released when file execution ends
   - Heap or outer stack frame as needed
   - Reflects file-unit modularity
   - Large room for compile-time optimization

3. **Export (Project Unit)**
   - Variables/functions defined with prefix # operator
   - Maintained until project-wide execution ends
   - Must be allocated on heap
   - Shared resources across multiple files

When a project operates as an OS, exported resources become persistent. This makes sense when considered as system variables or global resources.

This hierarchical memory management is highly consistent with Sign language's design philosophy while ensuring execution efficiency. Clear scope demarcation allows the compiler to accurately understand each variable's lifetime and determine optimal memory placement.

In AArch64 implementation, optimizations corresponding to these divisions (register allocation, stack frame design, heap allocation) become possible, achieving both theoretical beauty and execution efficiency.

### 4.2 Region-based Model and Sign Language Affinity

#### 4.2.1 Natural Correspondence with Scope Hierarchy
- Anonymous scope â†’ Temporary region (registers or temporary stack)
- Local scope â†’ File region (bulk release at file execution end)
- Export scope â†’ Global region (maintained until program end)

#### 4.2.2 Efficiency of Bulk Allocation/Release
- Avoids fragmentation through bulk operations per region
- No overhead for individual object tracking
- Predictable memory usage in bare metal environments

#### 4.2.3 Consistency with Language Design
- Matches the philosophy of "invisible strength"
- Programmers don't need to be conscious of explicit memory management
- Compiler automatically determines appropriate region allocation

### 4.3 Implementation Approach

The following strategies are effective for concrete implementation:

#### 4.3.1 Region Pool Design
- Fixed-size pools corresponding to each scope type
- Simple bump pointer method for allocators
- Only allocation within regions, release by region unit

#### 4.3.2 Compile-time Optimization
- Static analysis determines optimal region for each variable
- Detection of temporary objects allocatable on stack
- Elimination of unnecessary heap allocations

#### 4.3.3 Internal Fragmentation Countermeasures
- Small regions for short-lived objects
- Large regions for long-lived objects
- Dynamic region size adjustment feature

### 4.4 Bare Metal Environment Implementation

For AArch64 bare metal implementation:

```assembly
// Region initialization (example: file scope)
mov x0, #REGION_SIZE
bl alloc_region
mov x20, x0  // Hold region base address in x20

// Intra-region allocation (simple bump allocator)
mov x0, x20
add x1, x0, #ALLOCATION_SIZE
str x1, [x0, #OFFSET_NEXT_FREE]
add x0, x0, #HEADER_SIZE

// Region release (at file execution end)
mov x0, x20
bl free_region
```

This approach enables Sign language implementation without complex GC logic. The region-based model is particularly effective in bare metal environments, achieving predictable performance and low overhead.

## 5. Conclusion

### 5.1 Theoretical Speed Improvement

**Sign language's dual stack structure is faster than standard C methods under the following conditions**:

1. **Expression Evaluation**: Especially continuous arithmetic operations like four arithmetic operations
2. **Small to Medium List Operations**: When completed within registers
3. **Functional Programming Patterns**: Higher-order functions like MAP, FOLD, FILTER

**Theoretical Speed Improvements:**
- Simple arithmetic operations: About 20-40% speed improvement
- List operations: Several times speed improvement depending on conditions
- Combined with SIMD optimization: Up to 10+ times speed improvement possible

### 5.2 Effects of Design Integration

Sign language's AArch64 implementation strategy is designed to achieve high performance while emphasizing simplicity. The dual stack structure and scope-based memory management provide significant benefits especially in environments where low-level optimization is important, such as embedded systems and system programming.

Consistent use of data stack registers also contributes to cache efficiency and CPU pipeline optimization, likely improving overall performance. Through this implementation strategy, Sign language has great potential as a language that is not only theoretically beautiful but also operates highly efficiently in actual computing environments.
