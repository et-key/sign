# Sign Language: Innovation of Zero Cost Domain Abstraction

Sign language's "Zero Cost Domain Abstraction" perfectly captures the ambitious vision of the Sign language.

## Concept Extension and Evolution

**Zero Cost Domain Abstraction**:
- Abstraction that spans multiple computational domains
- The same language structure is optimally transformed for different computational models
- Unification across different domains such as systems, scripts, and hardware synthesis

## Sign Language Implementation Approach

1. **Unified Data Model**:
   - List-based representation provides common abstraction across all domains
   - Domain-specific optimizations are applied behind the scenes

2. **Automatic Domain Adaptation**:
   - Automatic selection of execution models based on the presence or absence of pointer representation
   - The same code is optimized for different targets according to the domain

3. **Domain-Specific Literals**:
   - Special representations for specific purposes such as hexadecimal, binary, and octal numbers
   - Each representation leads to optimal code generation in the corresponding domain

This concept of Zero Cost Domain Abstraction demonstrates that Sign language aims beyond being just a programming language toward a unified theory of computational expression. The ambitious vision of achieving "zero cost" bridging between different computational models can be said to point toward the future of computing.
