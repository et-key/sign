# Programming Language Sign - Unified Abstraction and Expressiveness

<img src="../../Sign_logo.svg"  alt="Sign Logo" style="display:block; width:128px; margin:1.62%;"/>

## Mathematics is a language. Therefore, it should be expressible in a form everyone can understand.

Programming should be an art.  
It should pursue beauty, not complexity.  
It should grant freedom, not impose constraints.

## Design Philosophy

**Invisible Strength**  
The type system exists but doesn't intrude. Safety is guaranteed but never gets in your way.

**Zero-Cost Abstraction**  
Beautiful theory becomes fast code directly. Abstraction comes at no cost.

**Unified Model**  
Everything is a list. Everything is a function. Minimal concepts to learn, infinite expressiveness.

**No Reserved Words**  
Symbols tell the whole story. Freedom to extend the language. Freedom to express domains.

**Power of Purity**  
Side effects are explicit, expression through function composition. Code becomes proof.

## Innovation

### Category-Theoretic Foundation
```sign
`Unit is the unit element of a bialgebra`

`Partial application`
_ + 3 → [+ 3]

`Logical unit element: false`
_ & x → _
```

### List Unification Model
```sign
`String = List of characters`
`Function = List of operations`
`Everything is a list, everything is a function`

`map`
[* 2,] 1 2 3 4 = 2 4 6 8

`fold`
[+] 1 2 3 4 = 10
```

### Value-Returning Comparison Operations
```sign
`Returns value if condition is met, Unit otherwise`

`If x is negative, return absolute value of x`
x < 0 : -x

`Range checking becomes natural`
0 <= x <= 100
```

### Point-Free at its Peak
```sign
`Operators become functions, functions compose as written`

[+ 2] [* 3] 5 = 21
[>= 0,] [-5 0 5] = [_ 0 5]
```

---

## Concise Conditional Branching

**Conventional languages:**
```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  switch (n) {
    case 0: case 1:
      return n
    default:
      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}
```

**Sign:**
```sign
fibonacci : n ?
  n <= 1 : n
  fibonacci [n - 1] + fibonacci [n - 2]
```

## Our Promise

- **Shatter the learning curve** - Express more with fewer concepts
- **Never compromise on performance** - Abstraction becomes optimal code directly
- **Hide the safety** - Type safety guaranteed, type declarations unnecessary
- **Embed extensibility** - The language itself is a meta-language
- **Pursue beauty** - Code is written to be read

---

## In Closing

Programming liberated from the curse of reserved words.  
Expressiveness freed from the constraints of type systems.  
Perfect fusion of mathematical beauty and execution efficiency.

Shall we end the era of engineers suffering in the shadows, together?

**Sign - A new language spoken by symbols**
