# Sign Language Module Design Eliminating Memory Waste

## Problems with C/C++ Include Model

1. **Duplicate Code Generation**:
   - Headers are expanded in each translation unit
   - Many duplicate codes are generated during compilation stage
   - Duplicates are eliminated at link time, but this leads to inefficiency in the overall build process

2. **Static Data Ambiguity**:
   - `static` variables may be replicated in each translation unit
   - Unexpected behavior from combinations of inline functions and static data

3. **Preprocessor Limitations**:
   - Primitive mechanism based on text substitution
   - Macro name conflicts and scope issues

## Sign Language Solutions

Sign language can adopt a fundamentally different approach centered on `@` import and `#` export operators:

1. **Symbol-based Import**:
   - Import only necessary symbols, not entire files
   - No code duplication, only one instance in memory

2. **Explicit Export Only**:
   - Only symbols marked with `#` operator are accessible externally
   - No unintended symbol leakage

3. **Entity-based Compilation**:
   - No separation between headers and sources, always compile entities
   - Binary contains only necessary code

This model fundamentally eliminates the problem of "having two stdio instances in memory" and enables more efficient memory usage and build processes.

Sign language can provide a sophisticated solution to this long-standing programming language challenge through clear hierarchical organization of memory regions and simplification of module design.
