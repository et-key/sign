# Sign Language Operator Symbol Table (Priority Order)

## Basic Principles
- Expression using only operators without reserved words
- Alignment between natural meaning of symbols and operational meaning
- Arranged from lowest priority (evaluated later) to highest priority

## Design Philosophy
- **Symbols understandable by everyone**: Prioritize intuitive understanding over mathematical rigor
- **Correspondence with natural language**: Programs can be read as sentences
- **Elimination of reserved words**: Avoid ambiguity of word meanings, emphasize clarity of symbols
- **Function as meta-language**: Any language paradigm can be implemented as functions
